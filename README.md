Features include:

Date/Year

Region/State

Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)

Labour Participation Rate

Employment Rate

🛠 Tools Used

Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

🔄 Steps Performed

Loaded and cleaned the dataset

Handled missing values

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
